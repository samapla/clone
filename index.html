            <p id="gogo">There was a book lying near Alice on the table,
                and while she sat watching the White King (for she
                was still a little anxious about him, and had the
                ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted
                again), she turned over the leaves, to find some
                part that she could read, <span class="spoken">
                    "&mdash;for it's all in some language I don't know,"
                </span> she said to herself.</p>
            <div id="yebo">It was like this.</div>

            <p id="mtn">She puzzled over this for some time, but at last
                a bright thought struck her. <span class="spoken">
                    "Why, it's a Looking-glass book, of course! And if
                    I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the
                    right way again."</span></p>
